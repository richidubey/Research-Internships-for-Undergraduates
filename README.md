# Research Internship for Undergraduates

#### This is a non-exhaustive list of opportunities available to Undergraduate students. Many of these positions are only focussed towards Indian students.

I am making this list as an attempt to fill the void of any such open source list. Your contribution is vital to keep the list up-to-date for future students to use. Hence it's a humble request to each user to contribute any new opportunity you discover and update the old ones. Without updation, the web-links will break, and the list will become redundant! I'll make sure that any such modification in the `README.md` raised as an issue or submitted as a pull request will be timely reviewed and added.

The following are some global research internship positions:
